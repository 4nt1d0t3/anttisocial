# AnttiSocial
A social media platform built with Firebase, React and Redux.

This "Twitter Clone" is the largest web application I have built so far. It is also the first project I built with React and Redux.

The learning curve on React and Redux was quite large but very rewarding in the end. 

# How to use the site
Log in using "new@email.com" as email and "password" as password or create your own profile by signing up.
Once logged in you will be able to post your own "screams" (what the posts are called in this app), like other people's screams, comment on screams, delete your own screams and comments and edit your profile, including changing the profile picture.
Clicking on the name of the user who posted the scream or comment will take you to their profile page that shows their profile details, as well as all the screams that user has posted.

# What I learned, what I struggled with
As I mentioned above, this was the first time I used React in a project. It was a welcome challenge in the beginning and by the end of the project I truly felt like I had a good understanding of React Hooks.

As if learning React wasn't enough, I also learnt Redux during this project with no previous experience. This was no doubt the biggest challenge for me during this project.
Adding Redux to the project was a hassle at first, but again, by the end I was very glad I stuck with it.
